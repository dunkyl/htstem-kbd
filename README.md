# HTSTEM Keyboard

CAD files for the HTSTEM keyboard.

## Macro12

Test board for the project. 12 keys, 12 addressible LEDs, and rotary encoder. First time I've actually gone through with ordering a PCB to be made.

Source code for firmware is at [another repo](https://github.com/dunkyl/dunkylmacro12).

BOM for macro12:

| Quantity | Description | Link | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Teensy 2.0 | https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html | Or any compatible microcontroller. I used an [Elite-C from Keebio](https://keeb.io/collections/diy-parts/products/elite-c-low-profile-version-usb-c-pro-micro-replacement-atmega32u4) |
| 1 | PEC11 12mm Rotary Encoder | https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/bourns-inc/PEC11L-4220F-S0015/2440942 | |
