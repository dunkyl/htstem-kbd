# HTSTEM Keyboard

CAD files for the HTSTEM keyboard.

## Macro12

Test board for the project. 12 keys, 12 addressible LEDs, and rotary encoder. First time I've actually gone through with ordering a PCB to be made.

BOM for macro12:

| Part | Quantity | Description | Link | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | Teensy 2.0 | https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html | Or any compatible microcontroller. I used an [Elite-C from Keebio](https://keeb.io/collections/diy-parts/products/elite-c-low-profile-version-usb-c-pro-micro-replacement-atmega32u4) |
| 2 | 1 | PEC11 12mm Rotary Encoder | https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/bourns-inc/PEC11L-4220F-S0015/2440942 | |
| 3 | 1 | Knob | https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/COM-10001/7229870 | Any knob really |
| 4 | 12 | Addressible LED SK6812MINI-E Reverse Mount | https://www.adafruit.com/product/4960 | 10 pack so buy qty 2 |
| 5 | 12 | Diode 1N4148FS-ND | https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/onsemi/1N4148/458603?s=N4IgTCBcDaIIwDkAsckA4BiBlAtAgIiALoC%2BQA | Or similiar |
| 6 | 12 | Key Switch | - | Your choice |
| 7 | 12 | Key Cap | - | Your choice |
| 8 | 1 | 3D Printed Case | - | Source files in this repo. Ask nicely if you want me to print you one |
| 9 | 1 | PCB | - | Source files in this repo. Ask nicely if you want me to give you one |
| 10 | 4 | Rubber Feet | https://www.adafruit.com/product/550 | Optional |
| 11 | - | Some tape | - | I used duct tape to hold the case halves together since my magnets that I had did not fit. |
